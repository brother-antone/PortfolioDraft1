        <h2>VGA Controller</h2>
        <article>
            <h3>Abstract</h3>
            <p>
                This project required using a DE1-SoC board for the implementation of the VGA on a 1280x1024 resolution and 60 Hz refresh rate screen. The main objectives were understanding VGA signal communication, employing phase-locked loops (PLLs), and implementing synchronization and display logic to render simple graphical outputs.
            </p>

            <h3>Challenge</h3>
            <p>
                The main task was creating a VGA controller capable of producing control and video signals for a monitor display. This required implementing a pixel clock using PLLs and understanding VGA timing standards, synchronization, and control signal generation. Developing controls to manipulate graphical figures on the display was another essential task.
            </p>

            <h3>Approach</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Phase-Locked Loop (PLL) Setup:</strong> A 108 MHz pixel clock was generated using Quartus Prime’s PLL tool, converting the 50 MHz reference clock into the desired frequency.</li>
                <li><strong>Synchronization Control:</strong> Horizontal and vertical sync pulses were generated using timing standards for the 1280x1024 resolution at 60 Hz.</li>
                <li><strong>Display Control and Figure Manipulation:</strong> Graphical figure movement and color changes were controlled via switches on the DE1-SoC board.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Experiment Setup</h3>
            <p>
                The experiment involved the DE1-SoC development board connected to an external monitor. Quartus Prime was used for synthesis and compilation of VHDL files controlling the display.
            </p>

            <h3>Results and Analysis</h3>
            <p>
                The VGA controller successfully generated video signals and displayed a consistent yellow background with two moving squares. The project demonstrated proficiency in digital design and hardware implementation using VHDL.

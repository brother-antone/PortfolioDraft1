        <h2>IR Decoding</h2>
        <article>
            <h3>Abstract</h3>
            <p>
                This project required the design, implementation, and testing of a NEC IR protocol decoder using the DE1-SoC development board. A functional state machine was developed to interpret the Altera IR remote and any NEC-protocol remote. Decoded data was displayed on seven-segment displays, while repeat codes were indicated with LEDs. Timing tolerances and noise filtering ensured accurate signal decoding in real time.
            </p>

            <h3>Challenge</h3>
            <p>
                Infrared (IR) communication is commonly used in remotes and automation systems. The NEC IR protocol defines a standard for encoding 32-bit signals into modulated light pulses. The main challenges were precise timing, data interpretation, noise filtering, and displaying address and command codes accurately.
            </p>

            <h3>Approach</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Understanding the NEC Protocol:</strong> Interpreted 32-bit signals including addresses, commands, and inverses.</li>
                <li><strong>System Design:</strong> A state machine was designed with states including Idle, Start_Detect, Decode, Verify, Display, and Repeat.</li>
                <li><strong>VHDL Components:</strong> Key files included IR_StateMachine.vhd, BCD_to_7Seg.vhd, HexTo7SegDisplay.vhd, and TopLevel.vhd.</li>
                <li><strong>Debugging and Testing:</strong> Timing variability and signal overlap were addressed using ModelSim simulations and Quartus Prime synthesis.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Experiment Setup</h3>
            <p>
                The system was designed and tested using ModelSim and Quartus Prime, with hardware validation using an oscilloscope. Inputs included the DE1-SoC IR receiver and remotes using the NEC protocol. Outputs were displayed on the seven-segment displays, while repeat codes were indicated on LEDs.
            </p>

            <h3>Results and Analysis</h3>
            <p>
                The IR decoding system was successfully implemented, achieving:
                <ul>
                    <li>Accurate decoding of 8-bit and custom 16-bit addresses from NEC protocol signals.</li>
                    <li>Correct data display on seven-segment displays.</li>
                    <li>Successful handling of repeat codes with LED indicators.</li>
                    <li>Minimal timing errors through signal normalization and timing tolerances.</li>
                </ul>

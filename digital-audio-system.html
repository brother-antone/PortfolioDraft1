        <h2>Digital Audio System</h2>
        <article>
            <h3>Abstract</h3>
            <p>
                This project required the design and implementation of a digital audio system that encodes and decodes sound using the DE1-SoC development board. The primary objective was to create a circuit capable of converting analog signals into digital form, storing them in a buffer, and then converting them back to analog signals for output.
            </p>

            <h3>Challenge</h3>
            <p>
                The goal was to develop a digital audio system that converts analog signals from a microphone into digital values, stores them in a buffer, and then converts them back to analog for playback. This required integrating the WM8731 audio CODEC with the Altera Audio IP Core, sampling audio at 48 kHz.
            </p>

            <h3>Approach</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Clock Generator:</strong> Generated the necessary clock signals, including a 50 MHz clock for the DE1-SoC and an audio clock.</li>
                <li><strong>Audio/Video Configuration:</strong> Initialized the audio system, set up the sample rate, and enabled audio I/O communication.</li>
                <li><strong>Audio CODEC Interface:</strong> Managed the analog-to-digital and digital-to-analog conversions, ensuring real-time audio processing.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Experiment Setup</h3>
            <p>
                The project was synthesized using Quartus Prime, referencing the DE1-SoC User Manual and Altera Audio IP-Core documentation. The hardware setup included a microphone connected to the MIC input and speakers connected to the Line-out output of the DE1-SoC board.
            </p>

            <h3>Results and Analysis</h3>
            <p>
                The digital audio system successfully converted audio input from the microphone into digital signals, stored them in a buffer, and played them back through speakers with minimal delay. Clear audio quality and correct synchronization verified the implementation of the clock generation, audio configuration, and CODEC interfaces.

        <h2>HPS-FPGA Integration</h2>
        <article>
            <h3>Abstract</h3>
            <p>
                This project required the design and implementation of a system integrating the DE1-SoC development board's HPS (Hard Processor System) and FPGA sides. The accelerometer (HPS) communicated with the LEDs (FPGA) to display tilt data. The primary objective was to create a system displaying the DE1-SoC board's tilt angle relative to the x-axis. This project demonstrated real-time data collection using low-level memory mapping for hardware communication.
            </p>

            <h3>Challenge</h3>
            <p>
                The project aimed to develop a real-time system that reads accelerometer data from the DE1-SoC's ADXL345 sensor and displays the tilt angle (x-axis) on the board's LEDs. Configuring the HPS and FPGA components using direct memory mapping was essential, requiring precise hardware communication and LED output control.
            </p>

            <h3>Approach</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Accelerometer Configuration:</strong> The ADXL345 accelerometer was initialized using I2C communication, configuring its registers and setting measurement modes.</li>
                <li><strong>LED Setup:</strong> Memory-mapped I/O was used to control FPGA-side LEDs by accessing hardware registers.</li>
                <li><strong>System Integration:</strong> Data from the accelerometer was mapped to LED patterns representing tilt angles in real-time.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Experiment Setup</h3>
            <p>
                The system was developed in C and tested on the DE1-SoC board using multiple source files. The board was tilted along its x-axis, causing corresponding LEDs to light up sequentially based on the detected tilt.
            </p>

            <h3>Results and Analysis</h3>
            <p>
                The system accurately displayed tilt data on the LEDs with minimal delay. The x-axis data from the ADXL345 was efficiently mapped, demonstrating proper memory management and data processing. The project successfully showed the potential of HPS-FPGA integration for real-time hardware control.
